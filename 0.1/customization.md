# Customize Avo

[[toc]]

## Logo

You can fully customize the logo section. Run `bin/rails generate avo:views` to create the default partials.

Next, in the `app/views/vendor/avo/partials` directory you will find the `_logo.html.erb` partial which you may customize however you want. It will be displayed in place of Avo's logo.

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/customization/logo.jpg')" alt="Avo logo customization" class="border" />
