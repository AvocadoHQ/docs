# Fields

[[toc]]

## Badge

The badge field can be used to display the status of a record in the database.

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/fields/badge.jpg')" alt="Badge field" />

```ruby
badge :stage, map: { info: [:discovery, :idea], success: :done, warning: 'on hold', danger: :cancelled } # The mapping of custom values to badge values.
```

By default, the badge field supports four values: `info` (blue), `success` (green), `danger` (red) and `warning` (yellow), having the possibility to override and/or add values by providing `map` parameter.

The `map` parameter is a Hash the has the state as the `key` and your agreed values as `value`. The `value` param can be a symbol, string or array of symbols or strings.

The Badge field is intended to be displayed only on **Index** and **Show** views. In order to update the value shown by badge field you need to use another field like [Text](#text) or [Select](#select), in combination with `hide_on: index` and `hide_on: show`.

## Boolean

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/fields/boolean.jpg')" alt="Boolean field" />

The boolean field renders a `checkbox` `input` and supports the following options.

```ruby
boolean :is_published, name: 'Published', true_value: 'yes', false_value: 'no',
```

You might not use `true`/`false` or `1`/`0` to store the value in the database. By using `true_value` and `false_value` you may declare different values for that database field like `yes`/`no`.

## Boolean Group

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/fields/boolean-group.jpg')" alt="Boolean group field" />

The boolean group is used to update a `Hash` with `string` keys and `boolean` values in the database.

```ruby
# Example boolean group hash
{
  admin: true,
  manager: true,
  creator: true,
}
```

```ruby
boolean_group :roles, name: 'User roles'
```

## Code

<img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/fields/code.jpg')" alt="Code field" />

The Code field generates a code editor using [vue-codemirror](https://github.surmon.me/vue-codemirror/). This field is hidden on **Index** view.

```ruby
code :custom_css, theme: 'dracula', language: 'css'
```

### Customize Theme

You can customize the theme of the Code field using the theme method. It defaults to `material-darker`, but you can choose from `material-darker`, `eclipse`, `dracula`. You can preview the themes here: [codemirror-themes](https://codemirror.net/demo/theme.html).

### Customize Syntax Highlighting

You can customize the programming language highlighting of the Code field using the language method. It defaults to `javascript` but you can choose from `css`, `dockerfile`, `htmlmixed`, `javascript`, `markdown`, `nginx`, `php`, `ruby`, `sass`, `shell`, `sql`, `vue` or `xml`.

## Country

Country field generates a [Select](/#sellect) field on **Edit** view that includes all [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes) countries. The value stored in the database is going to be the country code and the value displayed in Avo is going to be the name of the country.

You can easily choose to display the `name` of the countries in **Index** and **Show** views by declaring `display_name` to `true`.

```ruby
country :country, display_name: true
```

## Currency

The currency field generates a [Number](/#number) field that is automatically formatted using [Vue Currency Input](https://dm4t2.github.io/vue-currency-input/) to look linke a currency. You may use `currency` and `locale` to specify the sign and format of the currency field.

Be aware that `currency` defaults to `USD` and `locale` defaults to `en`.

```ruby
currency :salary, currency: 'EUR', locale: 'de'
```

## Date

The Date field may be used to display date values.

The **Edit**** view of the picker is using [flatpickr](https://flatpickr.js.org). You may use the [formatting tokens](https://flatpickr.js.org/formatting/) to format the **Edit** view element and the [moment.js](https://momentjs.com) [tokens](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) to display the **Index** and **Show** views element.

You may also pass the `first_day_of_week` attribute to have that reflected on the generated calendar component.

```ruby
date :birthday, first_day_of_week: 1, picker_format: 'F J Y', format: 'MMMM Do YYYY', placeholder: 'Feb 24th 1955', required: true
```

## DateTime

The DateTime field is similar to the Date field.

```ruby
datetime :created_at,
  name: 'User joined',
  required: true,
  readonly: true,
  first_day_of_week: 1, # 1 is Monday (default), 7 is Sunday
  picker_format: 'Y-m-d', # flatpickr date format
  format: 'YYYY-MM-DD', # momentjs date format
  time_24hr: true, # Whether to display the field in a 24 hour format
  timezone: 'PST' # The timezone in which to display the time
```

## File

The File field may be used to attach files using the [Active Storage](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) module.

```ruby
file :avatar,
  name: 'User avatar',
  required: true,
  readonly: true,
  is_avatar: true, # Whether to show the image next to the model in searches. Also sets is_image: true
  is_image: true # Whether the file is an image
```

## Files

The File field may be used to attach files using the [Active Storage](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) module.

```ruby
files :documents,
  name: 'User docs',
  required: true,
  readonly: true,
  is_image: true # Whether the files are images
```

## Gravatar

The Gravatar field is linked to the email from database, displaying the avatar image assigned to that email address in [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/) database. However, if
 the email address is stored in another column, you can specify that column.

On index, by default, the image is `rounded` and has size of `40 px`, but it can be changed by setting `rounded` to `false` and by specifying the `size` (in pixels) in field declaration.

On show, the image is always `squared` and the size is `responsive`.

You can customize the image shown when gravatar is not found by changing `default_url` (url) to custom image URL (for example company's logo).

```ruby
gravatar :email,
  rounded: false,
  size: 60,
  default_url: 'some image url'
```

## Heading
The Heading field is used to display a banner between different fields, such as a separator for big lists or header for different sections.
This field is not assigned to any column in the database.
```ruby
heading 'Address fields'
```
The options for this field include `as_html`, which renders your value as HTML.
```ruby
heading '<div class="underline text-gray-800 uppercase">Address fields</div>',
  as_html: true
```
On **Index** the field is not visible, because it is not necessary.

## Hidden
The Hidden field is used to display a value in a hidden input, mostly used to pass any value that doesn't have to be changed by user but is
 required to save the form.
```ruby
hidden :group_id
```

## ID

The ID field is used to show the record's id.

```ruby
id :ID
```

## KeyValue

The keyvalue field gives you the chance to edit flat key-value pairs stored in JSON format in database.

```ruby
key_value :meta, # The database field ID
  key_label: 'Meta key', # Custom value for key header. Defaults to 'Key'.
  value_label: 'Meta value', # Custom value for value header. Defaults to 'Value'.
  action_text: 'New item', # Custom value for button to add a row. Defaults to 'Add'.
  delete_text: 'Remove item', # Custom value for button to delete a row.. Defaults to 'Delete'.
  disable_editing_keys: false, # Option to disable the ability to edit keys. Implies disabling to add rows. Defaults to false.
  disable_adding_rows: false, # Option to disable the ability to add rows. Defaults to false.
  disable_deleting_rows: false # Option to disable the ability to delete rows. Defaults to false.
```
You can easily customize the values displayed in the UI by mentioning custom values in `key_label`, `value_label`, `action_text` and `delete_text`
 properties when defining the field.

You can enforce some restrictions by removing the ability to edit the keys of the field, by setting `disable_editing_keys` to `true`. Be aware that
 this option will also disable adding rows as well. You can separately remove the ability to add new row by setting `disable_adding_rows` to `true`.
  Deletion of rows can be enforced by setting `disable_deleting_rows` to `true`.

On the index you have to click on `View` to see the KeyValue field value.

## Number

The number field renders a `number` `input` and supports the following options:

```ruby
number :age,
  name: "User's age",
  required: true,
  readonly: true,
  placeholder: 'Happy Birthday!',
  format_using: -> (value) { "ðŸ¥‚ #{value}" }
  min: 0,
  max: 120,
  step: 5
```

## Password

The password field renders a `password` `input` and supports the following options:

```ruby
password :password,
  name: 'The password',
  required: true,
  readonly: true,
  placeholder: 'secret',
```

## Select

The select field renders a `select` element and supports the following options:

```ruby
select :type,
  options: { large: 'Large container', medium: 'Medium container', small: 'Tiny container' }, # The options that should be listed in the dropdown
  display_with_value: true, # Wether to display the values of the labels
  placeholder: 'Choose the size of the container.'
```

On **Index** and **Show** views you may want to display the values and not the labels off the options. You may change that using `display_with_value`.

## Status

The status field is used to visually display the state of a column, supporting the following options:

```ruby
status :progress, # The database field ID
  failed_when: ['closed', 'rejected', 'failed'], # The values for 'failed' state (text displayed in red)
  loading_when: ['loading', 'running', 'waiting', 'in progress'] # The values for 'loading' state (spinner shown)
```

Be aware that `failed_when` defaults to 'failed', while `loading_when` defaults to both 'waiting' and 'running'.

## Text

The text field renders a `text` `input` and supports the following options:

```ruby
text :title, # The database field ID
  name: 'Post title', # The name you want displayed
  required: true, # Display it as required
  readonly: true, # Display it disabled
  placeholder: 'My shiny new post', # Update the placeholder text
  format_using: -> (value) { value.truncate 3 } # Format the output
```

## Textarea

The textarea field renders a `textarea` element and supports the following options:

```ruby
textarea :body,
  name: 'Post contents',
  required: true,
  readonly: true,
  placeholder: 'My shiny new post',
  format_using: -> (value) { value.truncate 3 },
  rows: 5 # The size of the element
```
